				<h1>Hardware Report</h1>
				
				<h3>Motherboard</h3>
				<p>The motherboard is the main part of the computer. It is like the body that connects all the computer hardware. It allows all of them to receive power and communicate with each other. It holds crucial parts of the computer such as the CPU, RAM, etc.</p>

				<h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
				<p>The CPU (or central processing unit) is referred to as the brain of the computer. One main role it has is the operation cycle called the instruction cycle. There are three steps to the operation: first it fetches, which involves receiving an instruction. Secondly it decodes, which means it determines what the CPU will do with the instruction it fetches. Finally it executes the instruction. </p>

				<h3>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h3>
				<p>The RAM of the computer stores data temporarily. For example, it allows the computer to work with information at the same time. The more RAM the more information the computer can work with at a time. Say you have a tab open, the RAM is responsible for storing that info until you click out.</p>

				<h3>Graphics Card</h3>
				<p>A graphics card produces the image you see on your monitor. It decides how its going to project the pixels on the screen to make an image. It then sends this info to the monitor through a cable. The stronger the graphics card is, the better an image projects on your monitor. For example, there are some games that require a powerful graphics card or else the game would look terrible and not respond as quickly as others.</p>

				<h3>Hard Drive</h3>
				<p>A hard drive is an electro-mechanical data storage device. It stores and retrieves digital information. It is a long term memory of the computer. Unlike the RAM which is just for a short term period.</p>

				<h3>Optical Drive</h3>
				<p>Optical drives read and record CD’s and DVD’s. They also read and write on them.</p>

				<h3>Heat sink</h3>
				<p>The heat sink provides cooling for the computer. Computers get really warm especially when they are in use. This helps it cool off a little bit. It is also the loudest of all the hardware in this list.

				<h3>Power Supply</h3>
				<p>The power supply converts main AC to low-voltage regulated DC power. Has plugs for all internal components.

				<h3>Mouse</h3>
				<p>The mouse allows people to select things with a cursor on a computer screen. It is very essential because it is the way we navigate through our computer.
